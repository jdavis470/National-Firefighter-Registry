This page captures some of the background for the NFR project during the early stages of the project. Note that some fo the details (e.g. Implementation Guide) were changed after
project assignment, so I have retained the links here with our notes, but it's not applicable to our final project

## Motivation

### Medical Outcomes
https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/05/10/ff-cancer-facts/  
Key passage:  
"The study included nearly 30,000 career firefighters from Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco who were employed at any time between 1950 and 2009. 
NIOSH researchers found that, when compared to the number of cancers expected using U.S. population rates, the firefighters in this study had a modest 
increase in cancer diagnoses (9% increase) and cancer-related deaths (14% increase)."


### National Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018
https://www.usfa.fema.gov/current_events/071918.html  
Passed in 2018, this act requires and funds the creation of a national firefighter cancer registry.  Some key points of the aims:
  - Develop a strategy to encourage firefightersâ€™ participation in the registry.
  - Develop guidance for states and firefighting agencies about the registry.
  - Include data on minority, female and volunteer firefighters.
  - Seek feedback on the registry from non-federal experts.

## FHIR Implementation Guide

### General Details
These documents cover many aspects of implementation guides: their purpose, the design process, publishing, etc.
  - https://www.hl7.org/fhir/implementationguide.html : FHIR spec documentation for the implementation guide resource
  - https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation : HL7 documentation for how to publish implementation guide. Includes links to other examples of how to create IGs, but I think that we're going to use Trifolia-on-FHIR for this
  - https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/NPM+Package+Specification : Details on NPM Package Specification; one of the resources in IG
  - https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Publishing+Requirements : Requirements for IG publishing
  - https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Process+Flow : Don't think this applies to us, since I'm hoping we can workaround the bureaucracy, otherwise the timeline doesn't work for us
  - https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+IG+QA+process : QA process; again, not sure if this is applicable to us
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovbRwbd0uD8&list=PL4DUfomz2RZx0RZc2CTP0zGkQxSvk6DKe&ab_channel=HealthLevelSeven : Recorded Videos that introduce HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide Creation

### Trifolia-on-FHIR
  - https://trifolia-fhir.lantanagroup.com/help/Introduction.html : Some documentation here for specifics on using Trifolia for IG publication

## NFIRS Casualty Form
